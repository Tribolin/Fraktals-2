# Fraktals 2

**Fraktals 2** is a small collection of fun GPU-based visual experiments using OpenGL. Use the program selector to choose which module you'd like to run.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is still under development, so you may encounter bugs or unfinished features.

## Included Modules

### Mandelbrot Viewer

A simple shader-based viewer for exploring the Mandelbrot set.

### ❄️ Koch Snowflake

Generates the classic Koch snowflake fractal.

### 4D Julia Set Renderer

Renders a 4-dimensional Julia set in 3D, complete with a basic skybox.
SDF and normal calculations are based on this article:
[Inigo Quilez – Julia Sets in 3D](https://iquilezles.org/articles/juliasets3d/)

### 🌊 Fluid Simulation

An unfinished GPU-based fluid simulation. Currently a work in progress.

### Wormhole Renderer

Renders a wormhole using concepts from the paper by Kip Thorne et al.:
[arXiv:1502.03809](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03809)

### ⚛️ Orbital Renderer

Visualizes electron orbitals in the hydrogen atom. Also displays the associated probability density.

###  Double Slit Experiment

Simulates the classic double slit experiment to demonstrate wave-particle duality.

### 🧬 Lenia

Implements a simple Lenia cellular automaton.
Shader code adapted from:
[Shadertoy – Lenia](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/7lsGDr)

### 🌀 Raymarching Test

A basic test scene for experimenting with raymarching techniques.
